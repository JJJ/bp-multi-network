# BP Multi Network

A helper class for routing multiple BuddyPress networks in a WordPress Multisite environment.

This plugin segregates BuddyPress networks in a WordPress multi-network installation so that each WordPress network has a different BuddyPress social network. The user-base is still shared across the WordPress installation.

(Multiple WordPress networks can be created with the WP Multi Network plugin.)
